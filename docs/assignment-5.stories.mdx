## Intro

So far we've seen the good times of GraphQL, but what if a backend service turns out to perform badly?

In this assignment we're going to solve a performance issue client-side. First we'll have to introduce the issue by adding
a delay in `src/pages/api/prices/index.ts` by uncommenting `await delay(PERFORMANCE_DELAY);`.

## Assignments

### 5.1

The performance of the `price` field is blocking the user experience. The client should optimize for this.

- Split `items.query.graphql` into `slow-items.query.graphql` containing `id` + `price` and `fast-items.query.graphql`
  containing the rest -> Generate.
- Call both queries on the `HomePage`, make sure that UI is rendered as soon as FastItems is in and merge SlowItems with
  FastItems afterwards.
