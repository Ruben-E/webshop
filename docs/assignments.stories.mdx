## Intro

The owners of this webshop want to incrementally migrate towards GraphQL. This workshop looks into how this process works
and what perks and issues you'll encounter.

## Goal

The goal of today is to learn GraphQL. NodeJS and React are just implementation details, so the concepts you'll learn and
issues you'll encounter are framework independent. If you have issues related to React / NodeJS, feel free to be "inspired"
by the solution provided in each assignment because it would be a shame to waste time.

## Process

Since this is a remote workshop due to obvious reasons, it's hard to communicate with the audience so don't hesitate
to ask questions in Discord and respond to the Polls I create.

You can choose to checkout assignment 1 and try to make it to the end with your own code, but it is also possible to
checkout the solution and proceed to the next assignment.

During the workshop I will present a topic and reserve time for attendees to work on the corresponding assignments. If
you rather blaze through the assignments yourself, be my guest. It's also fine if you rather spend the time asking questions
and just follow along when we review the solutions. It's all up to you.
